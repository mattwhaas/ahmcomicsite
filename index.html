    <!-- Header -->

//in wide screen i'd like a giant banner centered with text buttons under the banner.
//in mid screen i'd like just a little bar and icons?
//in small i'd like the small logo and a dropdown
//first thing i'll need is a list of the menu items
//so here it is
//archive, store, contact? maybe a little newsletter signup in the future
//right now i can't arse with that though. keep it simple for now.
    <!-- /Header -->

    <!-- Left Button -->
//this is where the left button goes
//i want it to fade unless there's a mouseover
//i need to custom make the button so it fits my 'look'
//other wise it would look silly
//so also need to figure out left arrow keyboard 
//but it stops if there's nothing before it
    <!-- /Left Button -->

    <!-- Comic Mobile (sm)-->
//break the comics down by panel
//just use a flex box idiot
//that's the easiest way to do it 
//and you're going to be doing it for instagram anyway so
//anyway
//allign the comics vertically panels 1-4 top to bottom
//if you can figure out how to make swiping left and right 
//go next and previous that would be awesome
//if not then just whatever make the buttons hover
//toolbar above will manage size but for reference
//toolbar in small mobile mode should be the icon and a drop down list
//also hiding the plaque. we'll talk about the plaque later in full screen
//because it doesn't matter in small
    <!-- /Comic Mobile (sm)-->

    <!-- Comic Medium (md)-->
//medium will have the comics lined up in a 2x2 grid
//with panels 1-2 and 3-4 being the rows
//the buttons will hover, keep the swiping left and right just in case? 
//maybe lose the swiping. i guess figure out what size an ipad is or 
//wait i forgot about surfaces and touch screen devices so i guess 
//swipe stays in. whatever.
//anyway, toolbar is going to be the title and a dropdown
//
    <!-- /Comic Medium (md)-->

    <!-- Comic Full Screen (lg)-->
//this is going to have the comic in the center in 1-2, 3-4 order as medium,
//but the modal is going to be the full image if that's possible.
//I'd like it to be on a little pedesdal that only shows in large view
//on the base of the pedesdal i'd like to have a little plaque
//the plaque would be a modal list with a hidden side list
//the main plaque would be 'don't understand this comic?' and a dumb explanation
//the side menu would be a scrollable archive list
//i guess that means i have to title them
//but i'll title them like that bad far side glossary joke

//if that's too hard or i puss out on the 'dont understand' jawn, 
//then the plaque could just be the archive list with the one it currently is listed
//in bold at the top.

//side note but i think eventually it would be funny to have a "gift shop" with
//business hours. if you go during regular business hours it would look like
//a gift shop with someone manning a kiosk
//if you go after business hours then everything looks dark and
//there's a bandit raccoon casing the place, stealing stuff

//i don't know if that's possible but that'd be funny to me.

    <!-- /Comic Full Screen (lg)-->

    <!-- Right Button -->
//this is the same thing as the left button
//except it's the right button.
//the right arrow on the keyboard will advance it towards the end
//if there is no end, it stops somehow
    <!-- /Right Button -->

    <!-- Footer -->
//i dunno i guess i don't need this. maybe a little copyright information thing
    <!-- /Footer -->
